Solutions for Chapter 8:

1. Use the & operator.
2. You have to deference the pointer using * and assign the value to the pointer.
    e.g.
         *xPtr = 0

3. To create a new pointer you can either use new, or you can create a variable
than holds the address of the value.

   xPtr := new(rune)

   or

   x := 1
   xPtr = &x
