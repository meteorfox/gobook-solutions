Solutions to problems in Chapter 10:

1. Using '<-' arrow, to read from the channel you append it at the front,
to send to the channel you append to the back.

2. Implemented in gosleep.go

func sleep(s int) {
     c := time.After(s * time.Second)
     <-c
}

3. A buffered channel let's you communicate asynchronously, since it doesn't
have to wait until the value being sent to the channel is read.

c := make(chan int, 20)
